# Bob the plumber

This is simply a demonstration of using pygame with pytmx. It is not a complete game, and is not intended to be. It has
minor game functionality, and nothing else.

When making this, I used tiles created by MOSD3V at MOSD3v.itch.io. They are free, or you can donate to him, but I don't
hold the copyright, so I didn't include them, but you can download them.

## Requirements:
* **pygame**
* **PyTMX**
